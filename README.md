# UNC-System-Salaries---Tableau
This was a project in my INLS 541 Information Visualization Class. I chose to go ahead and make a series of visualizations to enable the casual user to gain a better idea of what the state of salaries are within the UNC system and at UNC Chapel Hill in particular. I started by providing an overview of the UNC System as a whole and then gradually providing a more granular view at UNC Chapel Hill. First on an individual departmental level before pivoting to an academic unit level  (which required a degree of aggregation given the nature of the data). 

Here's a link to the resulting Tableau [story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kyle.ashburn/viz/FinalProject-UNCSalaries/SalaryData).
